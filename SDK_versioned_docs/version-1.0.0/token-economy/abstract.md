# Abstract

Nerve is a decentralized system operating on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) based blockchains. The entire system is composed of independent smart contracts that operate independently and decentrally with mathematical security. 

Nerve Global runs on a fully decentralized framework with no central server infrastructure. All transactions are directly sent to the blockchain from a user’s device. Likewise, all data is directly read from the blockchain using [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/). Depending on the blockchain, Nerve Global might provide an optional custom Graph Node to improve reliability to The Graph’s hosted service.
