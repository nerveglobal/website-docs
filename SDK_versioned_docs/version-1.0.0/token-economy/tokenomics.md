# Tokenomics

The token is an extended ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum blockchain. 

In the process of creating a task, 5.00% fee is deducted from the initial stake, which on the one hand benefits the community and on the other hand counteracts possible attack scenarios. The initial stake of the task creator is obligatory for all further participants as a minimum stake. The fee of 5.00% also exists here.

The fees are automatically added to the NexusBurn (see below).

At the same time, new NERVE tokens are created, the quantity of which is derived from the current market price and the amount of the fee paid.
The participant receives 65.00% of newly created NERVE tokens according to the fee paid.
35.00% will accrue to NexusShares (see below).


**Two final scenarios will be created for each task**:

- The task is scored Negative by the majority. In this outcome, all participants, as well as the creator of the task, will receive their stake back. The previously collected fee is not returned.

- The task is evaluated positively by the majority. In this outcome, the creator of the task receives 95.00% of the total stake. 5.00% will go to the NexusBurn (see below).
