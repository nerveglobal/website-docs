# Funds Distribution Contract | NexusShares

For any newly created NERVE tokens, 20.00% will flow to the DAO. This results in the further following allocation:

- 10% to the Team
- 10% to Presale Investors
- 20% to the DAO
- 60% to Community


:::note
The NERVE token carries no governance voting rights, and conveys no ownership in the protocol.
:::

The total supply of NERVE is fixed and is indefinitely locked into the internal AMM liquidity pool on the Token Generation Event. The emission rate is based solely on usage of the protocol and directly proportional to collected fees. None of the Team, Presale Investors or DAO allocation buckets receive any NERVE tokens in advance. Rather, they only receive NERVE token when NERVE is minted from collection of fees from use of the app.
