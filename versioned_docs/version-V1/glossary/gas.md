Gas refers to the unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute specific operations on the network.

Since each transaction requires computational resources to execute, each transaction requires a fee. Gas refers to the fee required to conduct a transaction on the blockchain (i.e. Ethereum) successfully.
