## Centralized exchanges
Exchanges are businesses that let you buy crypto using traditional currencies. They have custody over any crypto you buy until you send it to a wallet you control.


## Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)
If you want more control, buy peer-to-peer. With a DEX you can trade without giving control of your funds to a centralized company. Decentralized exchanges are open marketplaces for ETH and other tokens. They connect buyers and sellers directly.

Instead of using a trusted third party to safeguard funds in the transaction, they use code. The seller's ETH will only be transferred when payment is guaranteed. This type of code is known as a smart contract.

This means there are fewer geographical restrictions than with centralized alternatives. If someone is selling what you want and accepting a payment method you can provide, youâ€™re good to go. DEXs can let you buy ETH with other tokens, PayPal or even in-person cash deliveries.

You will need a wallet to use a DEX.
