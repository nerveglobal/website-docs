A digital, global money for our digital future.
It is scarce digital money that you can use on the internet – like Ethereum. If you’re new to crypto, here's how i.e. ETH is different from traditional money:

## It's really yours
- ETH lets you be your own bank. You can control your own funds with your wallet as proof of ownership – no third parties necessary.

## Secured by cryptography
- Internet money may be new but it's secured by proven cryptography. This protects your wallet, your ETH, and your transactions.

## Peer-to-peer payments
- You can send your ETH without any intermediary service like a bank. It's like handing cash over in-person, but you can do it securely with anyone, anywhere, anytime.

## No centralized control
- ETH is decentralized and global. There's no company or bank that can decide to print more ETH, or change the terms of use.

## Open to anyone
- You only need an internet connection and a wallet to accept ETH. You don't need access to a bank account to accept payments.

## Popular types of token
Ethereum is home to thousands of tokens. Anyone can create new kinds of assets and trade them on Ethereum. These are known as 'tokens'. People have tokenised traditional currencies, their real estate, their art, and even themselves – some more useful and valuable than others. Developers are constantly building new tokens that unlock new possibilities and open new markets:

- Stablecoins
Tokens that mirror the value of traditional currency like dollars. This solves the volatility problem with many cryptocurrencies.

- Governance tokens
Tokens that represent voting power in decentralized organisations.

- Sh*t coins
Because making new tokens is easy, anyone can do it - even people with bad or misguided intentions. Always do your research before using them!

- Collectible tokens
Tokens that represent a collectible game item, piece of digital art, or other unique assets. Commonly known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
