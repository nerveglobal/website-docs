The Nerve Global DAO is the central decision-making organ of the protocol. All proposals and executions are handled on chain.

Voting rights in the DAO will be handed to community members according to DAO decision in the form of NFTs.
New voting rights are delegated every 3 months to the topmost participants in the protocol.

A further Nerve Global entity (Foundation or Association) to be established in Zug, Switzerland will help the community to reach its off-chain goals.
