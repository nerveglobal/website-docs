The Nerve Global DAO is the central decision-making organ of the protocol. All proposals and executions are handled on chain.

Voting rights in the DAO are very exclusive and are only handed to community members in the form of NFTs according to DAO decision.
New voting rights are delegated every 3 months to the topmost participants in the protocol.

A further Nerve Global entity (Foundation or Association) to be established in Zug, Switzerland will help the community to reach its off-chain goals.
