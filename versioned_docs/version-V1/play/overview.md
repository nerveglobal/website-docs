A Host creates a Task for a Hero and assigns both a minimum monetary reward (Loot) and a duration (Timer) for Task completion.  The Loot will be the native token of the blockchain specified for this particular Task.

The Host and/or the Hero broadcast the Task to the network for all to see.

Fans of the Host, Hero, or the Task can choose to join in the Task by pledging additional Loot for the successful completion of the Task.
The Hero can choose to complete the Task while the Timer is active.  Successful completion of the Task should be supported by a submitted Proof to the relevant social media (Youtube, TikTok, etc).  The Hero may also choose not to accept the Task by not completing it within the specified Timer.

## The Conclusion
There are 2 ways that a Task becomes final

1. The Timer expires

2. More than 50% have voted Yes/No. 

Once a Task is Final, if the majority of Fans have voted Yes (that the Proof was sufficient based on the specifics of the Task) then the Loot is transferred to the Hero. If the Vote concludes No, then the Loot is returned to the Fans.
