:::caution 
**PLEASE REVIEW THIS PORTION CAREFULLY**
:::

Once you open the app, you will be prompted to choose an 8 digit PIN to generate a new wallet, or import an existing wallet. 

If you create a new wallet, you will generate a 12 word secret phrase, which you need to write down and **store somewhere safe**.  If you need to reinstall the app or forget your PIN, you will need to use this secret phrase to recover your existing wallet.  

:::danger
**DO NOT GIVE THIS PHRASE TO ANYONE!**
:::

Nerve team members will never ask you for this information.  If you give this information to anyone, you are likely to lose all of your funds.

Follow the on-screen prompts until you see that your wallet has been successfully created.
